# bitstream_autocorrelation

This repository is a proof-of-concept.

If you landed here from my Bitstream Autocorrelation articles ([here](https://www.cycfi.com/2018/03/fast-and-efficient-pitch-detection-bitstream-autocorrelation/), [here](https://www.cycfi.com/2018/04/fast-and-efficient-pitch-detection-bliss/) and [here](https://www.cycfi.com/2018/06/fast-and-efficient-pitch-detection-synth-tracking/)), you might want to look at the [Q Audio DSP Library](https://github.com/cycfi/Q) where this is being actively developed.
